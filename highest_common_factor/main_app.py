"""
The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:
- If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.  
- If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.  
- Write A in quotient(Q)-remainder(R) form  -> A = Bâ‹…Q + R
- Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)
