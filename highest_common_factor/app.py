""" This program finds the highest common factor among a set of number
- starting with a list of 2 items then 4 then 10 until the logic is developed
- takes in only positive numbers in infinite range
- returns the hcf
- logic: calculate all factors of each number in separate lists. Then find the max of the common between those two lists
- (if time see to implement logic to omit unnecessary divisibility calculations.)

# The Euclidean Algorithm for Greatest Common Factor
"""
The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:
- If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.  
- If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.  
- Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
- Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)
